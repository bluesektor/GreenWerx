# TreeMon Project #
### Cannabis Management System ###


***Tree**: slang term used for marijuana. a.k.a. weed, pot, smoke and various others.*

***Monitor**: an instrument or device used for observing, checking, or keeping a continuous record of a process or quantity.*

***TreeMon**: an open source software solution used for recording day to day operations of a cannabis related business.*

 TreeMon.org is an open source start-up project looking to disrupt the conventional "seed to sale" market with software specifically designed to the industry aka Cannabis Management System. By moving to open source and tailoring the software to the industry, we are working to create confidence in a community not only skeptical of outsiders, but help us move forward after so many failures from other companies. No longer will you have to depend on a third party for your information and be at the mercy of someone elses internet connection. You will have the power to keep, run and manage your own system and data as you see fit.
