        VOLUNTEERS AND  [DOMAIN]
    </p> <p>
        [DOMAIN] appreciates the significant contributions made by volunteers, who assist  [DOMAIN] in its efforts to provide high quality,
        community driven online services. To help achieve this goal,  [DOMAIN] volunteers perform a variety of technical and non-technical tasks,
        including, but not limited to, programming, the creation of web-based content (HTML, BML, and other formats), graphic design, audio and/or
        visual content creation, technical writing, managing electronic data libraries and/or databases, technical support, reviewing, categorizing,
        legal assistance, archiving and/or forwarding electronic data, providing expert advice, administration, management, accounting, research, content creation,
        promotions, or other assignments, as needed. All volunteers are expected to be of legal age, or volunteering with the consent of a legal parent or guardian.
    </p> <p>
        By accepting these Terms of Service, any  [DOMAIN] member agrees that the intellectual content created as a result of volunteer
        work for  [DOMAIN] constitutes intellectual property of  [DOMAIN] and that all rights in said content shall vest in  [DOMAIN] at the time that it is created, to the extent permitted by law. If laws prevent such vesting, the volunteer makes assignment of all such rights to  [DOMAIN] at the time of creation. If laws prevent such assignment, the volunteer grants a perpetual world wide irrevocable license to  [DOMAIN] to use said content. If laws prevent such licensing, the volunteer agrees never to sue  [DOMAIN] for the use of said content.

    </p> <p>
        The volunteer certifies that any electronic data he/she submits is his/her work and that to the best of the volunteer’s knowledge,
        the electronic data is not claimed by another. The volunteer agrees to insure that any work provided is correct, error free and does not
        contain any inflammatory language, indecency or obscenities. Furthermore, if said work is found to be illegally presented, claimed, or forged,
        [DOMAIN] may remove such material and, at  [DOMAIN]’s discretion, seek action against the individual(s) from which the work originated.
        No  [DOMAIN] user is required to become a volunteer to this service, and users without volunteer status will receive reasonable support and
        attention as well. Without the expressed written confirmation to the contrary, all  [DOMAIN] positions are assumed to be taken without pay or
        future consideration.
